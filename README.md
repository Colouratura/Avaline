# Avaline
Avaline is a hacked together playground for interacting with MediaWiki sites in the C language.

This project is inspired by and uses some code from [CurlyChatBot](https://github.com/callofduty4/CurlyChatBot).

This project is primarily made on Windows using MS Visual Studio 2017 but should work on other fairly newer versions of Visual Studio as well. That being said the code is not specific to Visual Studio so one could just as easily write a make file to compile it under GCC.
